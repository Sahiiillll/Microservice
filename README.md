# emailservice

This Dockerfile effectively sets up a Python application environment, including dependencies, configuration for unbuffered logging and potential profiling, and integrates a gRPC health probe for service monitoring.

### Framework:
There is no specific framework mentioned in the Dockerfile, but it's assumed to be a custom Python application using email_server.py as the entry point.

### Technology Stack:
Language and Dependencies Management: Python (version 3.10.8) and pip for installing packages listed in requirements.txt
Tools: Utilizes wget, g++, and grpc_health_probe for additional functionality and monitoring
Environment Configuration: Sets PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 for unbuffered logging and ENABLE_PROFILER=1 for optional profiling

# Jenkins File explain
This Jenkins Pipeline script automates the build and push process for a Docker image. It uses Docker registry credentials (docker-cred) and the Docker CLI (docker) tool to build an image tagged as mamir32825/emailservice:latest and subsequently push it to a Docker registry. The stages ensure that the Docker image is built and tagged correctly before being deployed or used further in the CI/CD pipeline.
